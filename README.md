# 🧮 Suggested DAX Measures

Include these in your GitHub for clarity.

Total Revenue = SUM(fact_sales[price])

Total Transactions = COUNT(fact_sales[transaction_id])

Average Basket Size = 
DIVIDE(
    SUM(fact_sales[quantity]),
    [Total Transactions]
)

AOV = 
DIVIDE(
    [Total Revenue],
    [Total Transactions]
)

Revenue YoY = 
CALCULATE(
    [Total Revenue],
    DATEADD(dim_calendar[date], -1, YEAR)
)

Revenue YoY Growth % =
DIVIDE([Total Revenue] - [Revenue YoY], [Revenue YoY])

Transactions MoM % =
VAR PrevMonth =
    CALCULATE([Total Transactions], DATEADD(dim_calendar[date], -1, MONTH))
RETURN DIVIDE([Total Transactions] - PrevMonth, PrevMonth)
